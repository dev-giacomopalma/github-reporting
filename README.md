GitHub Pull Request Reporting Script

Overview
This Python script generates detailed reports on pull requests (PRs) created by users in a GitHub organization. It extracts information about merged PRs, reviews, and code changes, and outputs the data into separate CSV files for each user.

The script is designed to help engineering managers analyze individual and team contributions, review activity, and code quality metrics.

Features
Merged PRs:
   - Tracks all merged PRs created by each user.
   - Extracts detailed information about the PRs, including:
     - Merge time (in hours).
     - Whether the PR was merged without approval.
     - Number of non-autogenerated changes.
     - Lines of code changed.

Review Activity:
   - Identifies PRs assigned to users for review.
   - Tracks whether the user approved the PR or left comments.
   - Flags PRs where the user did not participate (no approval or comments).

CSV Output:
   - Generates separate CSV files for each user, summarizing their PR activity.

   - Ensure Python 3.6 or higher is installed on your system.

   - Install the required Python libraries:
          pip install pandas requests
     
GitHub Token:
   - Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token with the following scopes:
     - repo (for private repositories).
     - read:org (for organization-level data).
   - Replace <GITHUB TOKEN> in the script with your token.

GitHub Organization:
   - Replace <GITHUB ORGANIZATION> in the script with your organization's name.

Usernames:
   - Replace <USERNAME 1> and <USERNAME 2> in the DEFAULT_USERNAMES list with the GitHub usernames of the users you want to analyze.

How to Use

   - Save the script to your local machine.

Set Up the Script:
   - Open the script and replace the placeholders:
     - <GITHUB TOKEN>: Your GitHub Personal Access Token.
     - <GITHUB ORGANIZATION>: Your GitHub organization's name.
     - <USERNAME 1>, <USERNAME 2>: GitHub usernames to analyze.

Run the Script:
   - Execute the script using Python:
          python script.py
     

Input Parameters:
   - The script will prompt you for the following:

       - Enter a specific username to analyze, or leave blank to analyze the default list of usernames.
     - Months to Export:
       - Specify the number of months of data to analyze, or leave blank to fetch data starting from January 1st of the current year.

Output:
   - The script generates CSV files for each user in the format:
          <username>prreport.csv
     
   - Each file contains the following columns:
     | PR URL                      | PR Created Date | Merge Time (hours) | Merged Without Approval | Non-Autogenerated Changes | Lines of Code Changed |
     |-----------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|

Example Usage
Input:
GitHub Username: AmrAbulazm1310
Months to Export: 6

Output:
AmrAbulazm1310prreport.csv:
  | PR URL                      | PR Created Date | Merge Time (hours) | Merged Without Approval | Non-Autogenerated Changes | Lines of Code Changed |
  |-----------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
  | https://github.com/.../1234 | 2023-01-15      | 12                 | 0                       | 5                         | 150                   |

Troubleshooting
Rate Limit Errors:
   - If you encounter rate limit errors, increase the EXTENDEDWAITTIME in the script:
          EXTENDEDWAITTIME = 120
     

No PRs Found:
   - Ensure the GitHub usernames are correct and the token has the necessary permissions.

Empty CSV File:
   - Verify that the user has created PRs within the specified time range.
